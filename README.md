This cookbook contains Datomic-related recipes (eg, queries, rules, schemas),
gleaned from Gists and other sources.
_Please_ tell me about interesting material!

I have edited the examples into [wiki pages],
adding information about caveats, idioms, motivation, use, etc.
Each page is formatted as a standardized set of sections
(reminiscent of Unix man pages).
The content mimics that of assorted "Foo Cookbook" volumes.
